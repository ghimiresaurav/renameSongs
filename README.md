## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Set up

After installation, keep all the files that you want to rename in the directory _files_. This script is designed to rename files of the format _abc - def ghi_ to _def - abc ghi_, and not mess with the extension of the files.

## Running the script

```bash
# rename songs
$ npm run start

# build typescript
$ npm run tsc
```

## Conclusion

After running the script, you should have batch-renamed files. Leave a star if you found this useful.
